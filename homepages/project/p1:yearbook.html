                Yearbook Team - Cheif Executive </a> </h1>
                <p>I have been nominated and choosen to be the leader of 2018-2019 yearbook team, my role as 
                    a leader is to lead the team and assist them when they need help. I will also be 
                    responsible for this yearbook to get sent and printed on time without any pages 
                    mistakes.</p>
                <p> My responsibility is to monitor the progress of the pages coming together
                    as well as working with the entire staff our supervisor for creating a plan
                    to produce a quality yearbook before the deadline of publishcations. 
                </p>
                <p>Some of the challenges that I have encountered is that some of the memebrs
                    will keep procrastinate until the last minute to finish their pages adn submit them.
                    And my solution to fix this problem is that I set mini deadlines before the 
                    final deadlines so that will allow me to have time to proofread and make any
                    last minute chnages on the pages. This is what makes this year's yearbook publish on-time.
