                    SB Hacks VII - Team Member (Devpost)</a></h1>
                    <p>For this hackathon, we have made a web app chess game. As my teammates and I 
                        are all beginners, we have litte ideas of how we are going to make this work. 
                        Each of us ask for a mentor to assist us throughout this project.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the start of the hackathon, we have thought of using only HTML/CSS and python as 
                        its backend to make this webapp. However, after consulting with our mentors, they suggest
                        us to make use of firebase and Vue.js to make the game instead. None of us have 
                        encounter Vue.js nor firebase before, so we have to learn them from the start till
                        the end within these 48 hours. One of my teammates and I are in charge with the frontend,
                        where we need to learn Vue.js, where both of us have not encountered before. This is the biggest
                        challenge that we have encounterd in this hackathon. 
                    </p>
                    <p>In the end, although we did not win anything. I have learnt a lot from this experience.
                        I have learn the new programming langaue of Vue.js and the use of firebase, and the 
                        teamwork that is required to make a groupwork successful.
                    </p>
