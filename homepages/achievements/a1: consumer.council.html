                <h1><a href ="files/February2019.pdf" target="_blank">Consumer Council Cultrural Award - Merit</a></h1>
                <p> The Consumer Council Cultrual Aware is a co-organised with the Education Bureau (EDB).
                    The programme is one of the largest project-based learning platforms
                    for local secondary school students in which participants select a
                    topic on local consumer culture for study and submitted a report
                    as their entry for the Award. </p>
                <p> My team members and I were interested in how companies uses KOL as a 
                    marketing techiniquue as a new form of advertisement. We want to find out to what 
                    extend does it affect consumerism as well as how might KOL shape our consumer decision
                    without us being conscious about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Something that is worth notice is that KOL not only affect consumerism habit but also
                    our life choices. As the more influence that KOL have, the more our definition of
                    "Value" will change accordingly. </a>
