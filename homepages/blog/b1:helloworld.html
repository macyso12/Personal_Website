                <h1>Blog #1 - Hello World</h1>
                <p>So today is 18th of January, which is also the day that I am making this website,
                    at first, the intention is to make it for fun as I am still in winter bredk
                    and have nothing better to do with my life. But it becomes making my own personal
                    website that I can build onto my resume.
                </p>
                <p>Okay. Now. Something about me. I am currently studying in Fordham university, 
                    majoring in Computer Science, which is also one of the reason why I am making 
                    this website. I want to improve my skills in different programming languages,
                    which also includes some frontend, although I am more passionate in doing backend
                    with C++ and python etc. But Frontend is pretty fun too. My hobby, as you can see, is 
                    coding, I like to code a lot. I can sit in front of the computer and just code 
                    all day long and not feel unproductive at all. I also like to learn new things, such as 
                    new programming languages, I have been learning Python, Java Script as recently Vue.js. 
                </p>
                <p>Okay, enough of my geeking out. Let's talk about something that I am looking forward.
                    I am looking forward to have my first internship, I think it will be a great 
                    oppurtunity for me to gain experience to aim for my future aspiration to become a 
                    software engineer / developer. My long-term goal is to have a full-time job as a 
                    software focused position in a high-rank company such as Apple, Google, IBM etc. 
                </p>
                <p>Well.. It's nice to meet you guys and thankyou for taking your time to visit my website.
                    I will be updating from time to time, so I hope to see you guys soon? 
                </p>
                <p>BYE! And thankyou for visiting!</p>
